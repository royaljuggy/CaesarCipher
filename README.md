# Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is the name of an encryption method, but in this case, it is a general name for this project which includes various text reading functions; including an encrypter.
The GUI is built using JavaFX.
There currently exists 5 tabs.

## Database 

This tab allows users to select a passage, reading, or any miscellaneous text (file format txt) which is then used to create a database of words and their respective frequencies.
Users must select a language for the database, which will come in handy for the Detect Language tab and Decrypter tabs.

## Explore Database

Once a user has used the aforementioned tab to create a database, they may choose to explore it here. Functions include sorting the database by word frequency, or searching if a word exists in a given database.

## Detect Language

After inputting a text, a user can select a directory of databases which will be used to analyze the text, and tell the user the language of it.

## Encrypt

Users input a text which is then encrypted using the Caesar Cipher encryption method (a shift of the alphabet).

## Decrypt

Users select an text encrypted through Caesar Cipher and a directory of databases to decrypt the text.
